                <p>I was responsible for the timely acknowledgment and efficient management of Snowflake, Power BI, and
                    Salesforce support tickets, ensuring they were escalated to the appropriate higher-tier teams for
                    resolution. Additionally, I monitored and responded to PagerDuty incidents and integration alerts
                    related to Snowflake, ensuring each issue was thoroughly investigated and addressed with urgency.
                    My role also involved overseeing and troubleshooting Airflow DAGs, proactively addressing any
                    failures to ensure seamless workflow operations. I actively contributed to meetings focused on
                    reporting, offering insightful perspectives and ensuring alignment with organizational goals. With a
                    keen eye for detail, I utilized advanced Excel skills for meticulous data entry, ensuring the
